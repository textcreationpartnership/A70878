            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was wholly beyond <hi>A P</hi>'s. de≈øign, when he was invited to the Conference, (now ≈øo much noi≈øed through the Kingdom) to proceed ≈øo far as to Print; but as he went to it, as to a private meeting, ≈øo he never intended (being returned home) to make any noi≈øe of it, more than by giving by word of mouth, a ≈øimple account of the whole matter, to ≈øuch as might privately de≈øire to know the ≈øubject, and ≈øucce≈øs thereof. But being alarm'd all <hi>Friday, Saturday<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, with reiterated reports of his being run down, and ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced with five, eight, fifteen of his fellow Je≈øuits, and of the Doctors putting many Que≈øtions to him, without being able to obtain any An≈øwer; at the in≈øtance of many <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who had been derided by the Dr's Party, as though their cau≈øe had been totally lo≈øt: <hi>A. P.</hi> thought him≈øelf obliged, after his publick exerci≈øe of <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Afternoon, to ≈øpeak to his Auditours as followeth; <hi>There having been many fal≈øe and ≈øcandalous reports of a late Conference, I conceive many
<pb facs="tcp:29726:3"/> here pre≈øent may be in expectation, of having now ≈øome account thereof; but it is not our cu≈øtom to give occa≈øion of offence by Pulpit clamours, and making private Affairs publick: And being not yet informed that the Doctor has begun, or countenanced the≈øe reports, I ≈øhall omit at pre≈øent to ≈øay any thing relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; though, if ju≈øtly provoked, the</hi> Sunday <hi>following, I ≈øhall give a ≈øincere full, and mode≈øt account of the whole.</hi> The Doctor having heard of this, was plea≈øed on <hi>Munday</hi> in the evening, in company of Dr. <hi>Cla.</hi> to give <hi>A. P.</hi> the honour of a vi≈øit in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to u≈øe his own terms, to <hi>expo≈øtulate with him,</hi> concerning the unbe≈øeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of making ≈øuch Conferences, the ≈øubject of a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit di≈øcour≈øe; adding, that he not having taken tho≈øe mea≈øures, it ≈øeemed rea≈øonable <hi>A. P.</hi> ≈øhould ≈øpeak of it in that nature, <hi>A. P.</hi> replied he was content, but that ≈øome means ≈øhould be u≈øed to di≈øabu≈øe the deceived multitude; to which the <hi>Dr.</hi> an≈øwered, he was willing to pro≈øecute the Que≈øtion propo≈øed, by writing, and that he would An≈øwer the difficulty out of St. <hi>Ambro≈øe.</hi> But <hi>A. P.</hi> ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that that was the lea≈øt part of his proof, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired the <hi>Dr</hi> would allow that he might produce all tho≈øe Te≈øtimonies which he would have alledged in in the Conference it ≈øelf, had not the <hi>Dr.</hi> refu≈øed to hear them; and that then the <hi>Dr.</hi> ≈øhould give his
<pb facs="tcp:29726:3"/> An≈øwer. But the <hi>Dr.</hi> de≈øiring he might An≈øwer that of St. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> fir≈øt, <hi>A. P.</hi> a≈ø≈øented, and both ≈øides agreed, that the fir≈øt Copy ≈øhould be mutually ≈øent to the oppo≈øite Party. (Here the <hi>Reader</hi> is de≈øired to note, that this was the only Agreement made between the Parties in the <hi>Savoy</hi>) and there was no farther challenge on either ≈øide, much le≈øs, did the <hi>Dr.</hi> come to ask Pardon, as ≈øome are ≈øaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Now here was no mention made of giving, or not giving in writing, a publick account of the meer matter of fact pa≈øt, but only of going on with the points then in debate; and therefore if the <hi>Dr.</hi> charge <hi>A. P.</hi> with not ≈øtanding to his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (as he ≈øeems by his Letters to threaten) it will be without ground.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>A. P.</hi> ≈øeeing the fal≈øe and injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports daily increa≈øe, and that the <hi>Dr</hi>'s.

The <hi>Dr.</hi> ≈øeemed to take this ill, though without any grounds; he having then compleated a Narrative of ≈øeven or eight ≈øheets. And whereas he ≈øays in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <head>A True and Full RELATION Of the late CONFERENCE BETWEEN Dr. T. &amp; A. P. One of the MASTERS OF THE SAVOY.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ON <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th. of <hi>September,</hi> there came a Youth to <hi>A. P.</hi> who de≈øired to know, if he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept a Conference with Dr. <hi>H.</hi> He an≈øwer'd, he was; but on <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> it was told him, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> was the Per≈øon he mu≈øt engage with, at Three in the Afternoon on <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> follownig.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29726:5"/>2. <hi>On</hi> Thur≈øday, <hi>as was appointed, the Parties met,</hi> A. P. <hi>cume with one Witne≈øs, (no Prie≈øt,) the</hi> Dr. <hi>alone, who complaining that</hi> A. P. <hi>came with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, whereas, he had no body in his Company;</hi> A. P. <hi>reply'd,</hi> he thought it rea≈øonable, that ≈øome one ≈øhould be pre≈øent, that might be witne≈øs of all ≈øhould be ≈øaid or done on either ≈øide; But if the <hi>Dr.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not thereof, he was content, <hi>the Chamber (which now was almost full of People) ≈øhould be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that the</hi> Dr. <hi>with the Youth upon who≈øe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they met, ≈øhould remain alone with</hi> A. P. <hi>But the</hi> Dr. <hi>de≈øiring the Man of the Hou≈øe might al≈øo be pre≈øent,</hi> A.P. <hi>a≈ø≈øented thereto, upon condition he might al≈øo be allow'd likewi≈øe to have one Witne≈øs, to wit, Mr.</hi> M. <hi>the</hi> Dr. <hi>excepted again≈øt that Gentleman, and had a private debate with him; Whereupon</hi> A. P. <hi>was content that Gentleman ≈øhould retire, and pitch'd upon another who ca≈øually came in, tho' not known by name to</hi> A. P.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Here the</hi> Dr. <hi>≈øitting down, invited</hi> A. P. <hi>al≈øo to place him≈øelf by him, which he did; but</hi> de≈øired very much, that Pen, Ink and Paper might be brought, and every thing writ down which ≈øhould be ≈øaid on either ≈øide; <hi>but this was not accepted of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Youth appearing (for who≈øe ≈øake the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <hi>was</hi>) A.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29726:5"/> ≈øerve to keep the Youth in the Per≈øua≈øion he had been bred in: The <hi>Dr.</hi> reply'd, <hi>That the Boy had told him no ≈øuch thing, but that</hi> A. P. <hi>had told him of the contradictions of</hi> Luther; <hi>and when the</hi> Dr. <hi>asked him, what Book of</hi> Luther <hi>it was, the Youth an≈øwer'd,</hi> a Book in Quarto; whereupon the <hi>Dr.</hi> told him, <hi>That</hi> Luthers <hi>Works were not in that Volume, but in Folio.</hi> A. P. <hi>granted</hi> he had ≈øpoke to that purpo≈øe of <hi>Luther,</hi> and had ≈øhewn that <hi>Luther</hi> had taught now Seven, then Three, then Two, and at la≈øt only One <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and there being con≈øequently no Unity in his Doctrine, he had no Spirit of Truth in him: <hi>But he ≈øaid,</hi> he never had brought any Book to the Pulpit with him; Then the <hi>Dr.</hi> reply'd, <hi>The Boy began with a Lye, to which</hi> A.
